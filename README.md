## R7 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

I've built this market-app because I have a lot of neighbours around me that really love working in their gardens, some are unfit for work, but produce some really nice fruit and vegetables.
They would highly benefit from creating an account with out_Veggin and then others can find the items they are after and in the location, and instead of buying from the big companies and making them richer and richer, every one can make some money and have a small business for some decent income. It will bring the community together again like it used to be when every one would have small businesses and help each other.

## R8 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

It needed solving because there are many people unable to work and this gives them an oppertunity to work and make some side income.
I also notice a lot of fruit and vegetables go to waste because they simple cant consume it all them selves, so it is great for many different reasons.

There will be a messaging system so that people dont have to give out their phone numbers just in case they want to drop off the item or they cant pick it when they said they would

## - Target audience
My target audience is every one who would like to make some extra cash and enjoy growing fruit and vegetables. I am mainly targetting the stay at home people that either have no work, are out of work, or unable to work. This way they can still work and stay fit and healthy while staying home.

I used Heroku to deploy my application.
I used bootstrap and scss to style it.
I used Ruby to write the whole code and a bit of Javascript.

## R19 Provide your database schema design

Ive added in comments in my Shema file as per CoderAcademy instructions.
It shows what each line of code does on each table.
The reason we have t.index is just to make the code much more quicker to write and draw up a full table with only a simple few words of sytax thanks to our ruby gems.
The schema file is created once we run the migrate to migrate all the tables and let them all talk together in the way they are entered, where it be one to one , one to many, many to many, etc.
