## R7 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

I've built this market-app because I have a lot of neighbours around me that really love working in their gardens, some are unfit for work, but produce some really nice fruit and vegetables.
They would highly benefit from creating an account with out_Veggin and then others can find the items they are after and in the location, and instead of buying from the big companies and making them richer and richer, every one can make some money and have a small business for some decent income. It will bring the community together again like it used to be when every one would have small businesses and help each other.

## R8 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

It needed solving because there are many people unable to work and this gives them an oppertunity to work and make some side income.
I also notice a lot of fruit and vegetables go to waste because they simple cant consume it all them selves, so it is great for many different reasons.
